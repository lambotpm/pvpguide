## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Discipline Priests are unique healers that heal through a combination of damaging enemies and directly casting on allies. In BfA, the playstyle is very similar to how it played out in Legion PvP, but now we have a few new exciting talent and Honor talent combinations. 

This guide aims to provide some high level information on optimal talent builds, cooldown usage and strong team compositions for PvP in Battle for Azeroth.

**Disclaimer:** Battle for Azeroth has still not launched, and Season 1 does not begin until September 4, 2018. Currently classes are undergoing tuning changes multiple times per week, as are Honor talents and Azerite traits. This guide will be updated to reflect changes in balance as they occur.

## Glossary <a name="glossary"></a>

Before we jump in, let's define a few terms that you'll see throughout this guide and when interacting with the PvP community:

- *Purge* - Refers to offensively dispelling a target, namely *Dispel Magic* as a Priest. The term *Purge* is usually used to minimize ambiguity between dispel effects. Note that Mass Dispel also has a Purging effect if enemies are within its reticle. 

- *Dispel* - Refers to defensively dispelling a target, namely *Purify*. 

- *CC* - Short for crowd control, this term includes any spells that prevent an enemy player from interacting for a shrort time, such as *Psychic Scream* or *Mind Control*. *CC Chains* are when multiple CC spells are used in a row on a target, preventing them from playing for even longer. 

- *Comps* - Short for team compositions. An example of a comp is "RMP" - or Rogue/Mage/Priest. Some common comps for Discipline Priests are listed further down in the guide, along with tips on how to play them.

## Changes from Legion to BfA <a name="changes"></a>

[For a complete list of changes to Discipline in Battle for Azeroth, please check out this Focused Will article.](http://focusedwill.com/discipline-bfa-changes-final)

Changes worth highlighting in a PvP context:

* Our party stamina buff, *Power Word: Fortitude* is back. Note that it is a purgable Magic-type buff.

* *Clarity of Will* has been removed.

* *Plea* has been removed in favor of a zero-cooldown but weak *Power Word: Shield.* As this is now the standard single-target *Atonement* applicator, the Honor talent *Trinity* now works with *Power Word: Shield*.

* *Rapture* has changed to make *Power Word: Shields* an additional 200% stronger for its duration. **It is now on the global cooldown.**

* The Honor talents *Archangel* and *Dark Archangel* are **now on the global cooldown.**

* The damage reduction component to *Fade* is gone along with most other artifact traits, but we now have *Desperate Prayer* back as a personal cooldown. See the cooldown section for more information.

## Gearing<a name="gearing"></a>

Gearing in Battle for Azeroth is once again impactful! While player power will be scaled within instanced PvP, your secondary stats from equipped gear will remain intact. Further, trinkets are usable again. That means meaningful choices in terms of how you choose to gear your character!

Stats: int > haste > mastery > crit = vers.

TODO: Add Azerite Traits

## Talents<a name="talents"></a> 

#### Row 1

**Usually take -** *Twist of Fate*. Twist of Fate is still an incredibly strong talent for recovering from dangerous situations. It's a great choice when you're facing against a team that has a lot of crowd control for allowing you to recover quickly, or for when an enemy team is likely to tunnel and try to burst you down. When unsure of which talent to take here, defaulting to *Twist of Fate* is always a fine option.

**Sometimes take -** *Schism*. While Schism can provide a substantial buff to your damage output, it gives the enemy team another way to lock you out of the Shadow spell school, preventing you from being able to cast Shadow Mend in an emergency. Further, when you're in dire need of catch-up healing, this talent does nothing to help you recover. This talent can see use in the 2v2 bracket once you become comfortable with Discipline.

**Rarely take -** *Castigation*. Castigation gives a straight 33% buff to Penance. While this was the default talent for much of Legion, unfortunately, Penance isn't very good at this point in BfA. Unless you have a *Power of the Dark Side* proc active, it's typically better to just Smite for damage or Shadow Mend for direct healing rather than casting an un-buffed Penance. (The obvious exception here is for when you need to be moving while healing or damaging.) It can be very strong in 2v2 when paired with Honor talents like *Searing Light* and *Trinity* for keeping your team on the offensive, but typically is the weakest of the three options.

#### Row 2

**Usually take -** *Angelic Feather*. Priest is a very immobile class this expansion. Feathers can help you quickly cross enemy lines to drop a Fear or pull back to safety behind a pillar.

**Sometimes take -** *Body and Soul*. While not an awful talent, Power Word: Shields should be spent on mitigating incoming damage on your team, not providing speed buffs. The one upside to this talent is that it requires almost no management and also provides another dispellable buff on your allies, forcing enemies to purge more often to get off important spells. Against very Purge-heavy players (aggressive Shamans, Priests, even Mages), the extra buff to churn through can be a lifesaver.

**Sometimes take -** *Masochism*. If you think you're going to be focused by a melee team, Masochism can help keep you alive by providing more damage reduction. While Discipline Priests are reasonably tanky for a healer, there is some insane damage coming out in arena right now from melee cleaves -- if you find that you're having trouble staying alive, this talent can definitely help.

#### Row 3

This row not only depends a lot on your comfort level with Priest, but also what composition you're playing and what you're playing against. I go into detail about why I recommend *Mindbender* further down in the cooldown section of this guide, but it's worth mentioning that *Power Word: Solace* is also a good option. *Power Word: Solace* provides the most damage and most mana return out of all the talent options here in PvP situations, but it requires you to use it virtually on cooldown to not run into mana problems. 

#### Row 4

**Almost always take -** *Psychic Voice*. This talent reduces your AoE fear by 30 seconds, which allows for double the amount of crowd control going out against your enemies.

**Sometimes take -** *Shining Force*. The knock back effect from Shining Force can see some play in the Dalaran Sewers or Blade's Edge Arena maps to help set up line of sight difficulties for the enemy team. However, the same can also be accomplished by just Mind Controlling the enemy off. This talent can also be helpful against melee cleaves trying to train you down, as it will give you a few seconds of breathing room to get out a Shadow Mend on yourself.

**Never take -** *Dominant Mind*. It simply does not work in PvP.

#### Row 5

**Usually take -** *Sins of the Many*. Even with 3 active *Atonements*, this talent grants you a passive +8% damage buff. In Arenas, this is a go-to for helping put out pressure. In RBGs, even with a smaller damage boost while having lots of Atonements out, the overall value is the highest.

**Rarely take -** *Contrition*. This talent can be good if you're using defensive *Penance* almost exclusively _and_ have a lot of *Atonements* out. Maybe a good safety net if you're newer to RBGs, but still less throughput overall compared to *Sins of the Many*.  

**Rarely take -** *Shadow Covenant*. Even with its buffed values compared to Legion and reduced mana cost, this ability just doesn't shine.

#### Row 6

**Almost always take -** *Purge the Wicked*. While PtW no longer is a straight damage buff over the standard Shadow Word: Pain, its savings in arena come in the form of GCDs. It's important to keep SW:P/PtW on as many targets as possible to increase passive healing in Arena while providing rot damage, and being able to save GCDs by spreading with offensive Penance is very strong.

**Almost never take -** *Divine Star* or *Halo*. These both offer minimal healing in arenas, are expensive on mana, and more often than not will break CC. An exception for here is in RBGs, where *Halo* can shine when it's able to heal many targets. 

#### Row 7

**Always take -** *Lenience*. 3% damage reduction on everybody with an active *Atonement* is quite a massive bonus to survivability. Not only is this a huge boost to survivability for your whole team and requires _no effort_ to maintain, it's also just strictly better than the alternatives in a PvP environment. 

**Rarely take -** *Luminous Barrier*. The absorb effect of *Luminous Barrier* is exceptionally tiny on each individual player - about a 20k absorb at 366 item level, where health values are ~140k without Fortitude. While this amount gets buffed with the *Dome of Light* Honor talent, it's still very weak. The only time this talent may be worth taking is in huge unrated battlegrounds when you can get high value out of it - say on your whole team in Alterac Valley. Otherwise it's just weaker than *Lenience*. 


## Honor Talents <a name="honor-talents"></a>

In Battle for Azeroth, Honor talents have changed a bit in that you can select _any_ three talents you want, in addition to a "PvP trinket" talent. This opens up a lot more interesting combinations that weren't available or easy to play in Legion. 

Many of the talents have great situational uses, but won't be taken in every matchup. We'll be covering each of the PvP talents and discussing their strengths and drawbacks, along with suggesting when they may be the best option. Before each game you should take into account both what comp you're playing and what you're about to face, and change talents to give your team the optimal chance at success. 

### Trinket Selection 

**Usually take -** *Gladiator's Medallion*. This is the trickiest row in all the talents because the optimal choice depends upon both which race your Priest plays and also what team you're about to be playing against. Typically the best choice is to stay with the on-demand "trinket," allowing you to choose which enemy setups you need to escape for either saving a teammate or setting up a kill by landing a pivotal fear or throwing out some extra damage.

**Sometimes take -** *Relentless*. This can be a great choice against teams with minimal CC or several back-to-back blanket Silences. I find myself taking this talent much more often on my Human Priest (since the Human racial allows for a stun escape on a two minute cooldown) than I do on either of my Horde priests.

**Rarely take -** *Adaption*. This talent works best against teams with infrequent CC, or if your teammates are capable of breaking you out of some enemy crowd control (say a Retribution or Protection Paladin).


### General Honor Talent Pool

#### Very Strong Talents

*Dark Archangel*. *Dark Archangel* is quite a bit stronger in Battle for Azeroth than it was in Legion. Although it is now on the global cooldown, most offensive cooldowns are and can be aligned with your teammates for maximal burst. Since Discipline Priests typically play in control comps, this is an incredibly strong talent to pop when an enemy healer is stuck in CC to either force big defensive cooldowns or score a kill. 

*Ultimate Radiance*. This talent makes Power Word: Radiance instant cast and directly heal for a lot more than in PvE situations. It has a double effect of quickly applying a large amount of healing to the whole team (assuming they're relatively close to each other) _and_ applying Atonement to the entire team. And as of patch 7.2.5, Discipline Priests now have two charges of the spell, allowing for some serious instant cast burst healing to the entire group. This can be huge for recovering from split pressure against rot teams, or simply keeping one person alive while dodging interrupts and counter spells. Against caster cleave teams, this is a very strong option. In a RBG context, this spell is great for quickly getting out large numbers of *Atonements*.

*Premonition*. This talent is the stand in for the old utility of *Shadow Word: Death* - that is, it applies a small amount of damage to the Priest on a delay, allowing them to break incoming crowd control. You'll always want to take this against classes that contain breakable crowd control, namely a Mage's Polymorph, Hunter traps and Wyvern Sting, Shaman Hex, Monk and Feral Druid incapacitates, et cetera. There's almost always at least one use for this in a match. Down further in the guide is a list of CCs that *Premonition* can free you from. Further, in an RBG context, this spell can be used on cooldown to increase the duration of all of your active *Atonements*, allowing you to focus on using damaging spells.

#### Strong Talents

*Purification*. This is a standard "double dispel" talent and is great against any team with area of effect dispellable magic (a Mage's Frost Nova) or any team with spammable crowd control (Polymorph, Warlock Fear). A large portion of a healer's responsibility in arena is limiting enemy crowd control against your team and mitigating their damage - being able to dispel more frequently is key.

*Archangel*. While still a very strong talent, *Archangel* has lost its permanent-pick status that it had in Legion. As it is now on the global cooldown, it's less easy to use in an arena setting to quickly pick up teammates. It's still a great choice in matchups where you'll be able to sit back and free cast in between CC chains, but requires a bit more planning to use effectively. In RBGs, this is a standard pick due to refreshing the duration of all of your active *Atonements* and increasing healing by a huge amount. 

*Trinity*. This is quite a powerful talent in both 2v2 and 3v3 right now. Since the buff is applied when you cast *Power Word: Shield* on a friendly, it's virtually always passively active compared to having to use *Plea* to refresh in Legion. The only reason this talent isn't listed as Very Strong is because of how Discipline's damage breakdown has changed in Battle for Azeroth -- a lot of damage power has been taken away from Penance and put into Smite. If you're not able to stand back and tunnel Smites into the enemy often, you won't get very good value from this talent. It can feel very strong against rot comps in 3v3, or if you're able to play very aggressively in 2v2.


#### Weak Talents

*Searing Light*. This talent allows you to play a bit more aggressively with offensive Smites and Penances to help apply more pressure. Due to the amount of damage that goes out in 3v3 now, Smite is not a very common spell; this talent has a much better place in the 2v2 bracket, often paired with *Trinity*.

*Strength of Soul*. The physical damage reduction offered by *Strength of Soul* is still very strong, especially during *Rapture*, but unfortunately shields are generally so weak these days that the actual value of the talent is quite a bit lower than it was during Legion. This talent can still be good against teams that have all physical damage and no Purge effects. 

*Dome of Light*. *Dome of Light* adds quite a lot of value to both *Power Word: Barrier* and *Luminous Barrier*, but doesn't offer any value outside of their use every two minutes. This talent can be strong if you're facing against a team that has an incredibly powerful all-in every two minutes (maybe an enemy team pairing Dark Archangel with an Assassination Rogue's Vendetta), but that requires you actually getting the *Barrier* off when it is needed, and having no better Honor talent alternatives. 

*Purified Resolve*. Against teams with infrequent dispellable debuffs, this talent can be preferable to *Purification*. An example would be playing against Unholy Death Knights - there's typically rarely a need to defensively dispel, but doing so would somewhat limit incoming damage and apply a shield to help mitigate the single target onslaught. Typically there are better Honor talent alternatives.


## Common Compositions - 3v3 <a name="comps"></a>

Discipline Priest's main weakness in arena is the clock: simply put, we run out of mana faster than every other healer. Because of this, Priest works best in control comps - that is, comps where your team can lock down enemy players repeatedly to help ensure a quick game. The longer a game goes on, the faster a Priest will OOM and the tougher it will be to secure a victory. Combine this with our additional burst damage potential, and suddenly Discipline has an incredibly strong niche.

Let's take a look at some of the common strong compositions Discipline Priests are running in Battle for Azeroth, Season 1: 

**Note:** As the season is not yet live, and balance tuning is nowhere near complete, this section may need significant updates in the upcoming weeks. Stay tuned for up-to-date information about the arena meta.

### RMP - Rogue / Mage / Priest

This classic composition has been strong since as far back as *The Burning Crusade.* The idea here is to overwhelm the enemy team with as much cross-CC as possible to force defensive cooldowns very early on. In this composition, you will find yourself playing much more aggressively to try to secure a very early kill. Look for openings when you can follow up a Polymorph or Kidney Shot with a fear while your teammates lock everybody else in place.

### Thug Cleave - Sub Rogue / Hunter / Priest

With the recent buffs to Sub Rogue output and the insane amount of cross-CC available between Rogue stun, Hunter traps, your fears and Mind Controls, this composition can be incredibly effective when played well. Make sure you keep your eyes open for when you can follow up a CC chain (typically Fearing after a Hunter trap, or using Mind Control to steer an enemy into a dodged trap) and throw out some damage to help end games quickly.

### Cupid - Ret Paladin / Hunter / Priest

Similar to running Thug Cleave, Cupid works by setting up long chains of crowd control on an enemy healer while having a good amount of defensive utility. While Retribution Paladins are less strong in Legion Season 4 than they were previously, they still can put out some pretty scary damage while helping you avoid enemy CC with Blessing of Sanctuary. Typically, Hunters will use their Freezing Trap on a target stunned by Hammer of Justice: follow this up with a Psychic Scream for an incredibly long CC chain on an enemy healer.

### Jungle - Feral Druid / Hunter / Priest

This comp works very similarly to the previous two, Thug and Cupid. Since Ferals recieved a ridiculous damage and quality of life buff in 7.3 / Season 7, they're quite powerful allies to have. CC chains work similarly as before, where your Feral will Maim or Mighty Bash a target, Hunter traps off of the stun/incap, and you follow with a Psychic Scream out. If an enemy healer has to sit that whole chain (say, they don't have trinket available), your Druid with Incarn can easily shred the enemy team apart. Overall this is a really fun composition to play right now and can be quite strong.

## Common Opponents - 3v3 <a name="opponents"></a>

**Note: This section is currently out of date and under construction for Battle for Azeroth Season 1.** The meta quickly shifts on arena ladders depending on a variety of factors, particularly balance hotfixes. On the 120 Gladiator Realm at the time of writing this, compositions are all over the place while players experiment with new classes and different Azerite traits. That all said, there are a few timeless compositions that will certainly make an appearance throughout Battle for Azeroth. This section will be updated as the BfA arena meta continues to develop. 

### TSG - Arms Warrior / Death Knight / Healer

There are many variations on this composition now after the recent buffs to several melee classes (Arms and Havoc come to mind immediately), but the way you play against it is largely the same. This team tries to just overwhelm with insane damage and healing reductions to simply power through a target. Use your defensive cooldowns early (Barrier, Pain Suppression, Archangel) to keep your friendly target alive without too much overlap and try to help minimize incoming damage by CC'ing during their burst. 

### Walking Dead - Windwalker Monk / Death Knight / Healer

Playing against this composition is all about knowing when the enemy team is going for a kill. While their default damage can be quite high, you need to save your Pain Suppression for when a teammate gets hit with Touch of Death. Keep in mind because both of these classes are fairly front-loaded, they can swap targets pretty easily. Be mindful of your positioning and be ready to Life Grip back a friendly after they get Death Gripped into a bad situation. 

### WMX - Arms Warrior / Mage / Healer

With the class balance changes implemented at the start of Legion Season 4, Warrior teams have seen a huge resurgence on the ladder. Typically, against this team, the warrior will train one target on your team providing a steady stream of damage until the mage can land a few good Polymorphs and follow up with enough burst damage to land a kill. Focus on preventing setups by the mage by having your team interrupt Polymorphs, using the *Premonition* (the old "Shadow Word: Death"/Inquisition) honor talent to break out of as many Polymorphs as possible, and lining all other casts behind pillars as much as possible. 

## Cooldowns <a name="cooldowns"></a>

Many of Discipline's cooldowns have a damage reduction component to them, so it's important to anticipate when damage is about to come out and prepare accordingly. 

*Pain Suppression* - Reduces damage taken by 40% for 8 seconds. It's best to use this ability as heavy damage is starting to come out on a friendly, as it mitigates a huge amount of damage and heals a portion back. Be wary of popping it too early though and forcing a target swap. Keep in mind this is usable while stunned! 

*Power Word: Barrier* - Reduces damage taken by 25% for friendlies within it for 10 seconds. This is a really strong cooldown against melee cleaves where your friendly target has two people beating him up and he's stunned or snared in place. Also, note that you can place Barrier over a friendly target trapped in an enemy Rogue's Smoke Bomb ability and they still receive the damage reduction.

*Rapture* - Changed with BfA to dramatically increase the size of your Power Word: Shields for its duration. Note that although this ability now has a shorter cooldown than in Legion (1.5 minutes down from 2 minutes), it is also now on the global cooldown. This is a great ability to use when there's significant incoming damage and you won't be able to get out full casts without getting interrupted. Keep in mind that if you get locked on the Holy school during the duration of this ability, you will no longer be able to cast Shields.

*Mindbender* - A powerful 1 minute cooldown which does strong damage to an enemy but also heals through Atonement _and_ returns mana. While this is a great spell to use when going for a kill or just applying some counter-pressure and restoring mana, but it's also a way to keep heals flowing to your team while you're sitting in crowd control. If you anticipate an incoming CC chain and are able to Atone your team (say with instant cast Radiance or a combination of Plea and Shield) with Mindbender out, you can totally negate an enemy setup.

*Leap of Faith* - AKA "Life Grip." If your teammate is taking insane damage and you're in no immediate position to top them off (say, you're vulnerable to CC with no trinket up, or the enemy's Silence has just come off cooldown), you can often Life Grip them back to your pillar and have them hide with you for a few seconds while you top them off. This spell can also be used aggressively, such as standing at the other end of a Warlock teleport and pulling your melee towards the fleeing enemy. It's a difficult spell to use effectively but is strongly rewarded by proper positioning and overall arena awareness.

*Desperate Prayer* - This awesome ability makes a comeback to Discipline with Battle for Azeroth! It will temporarily increase your maximum health by 25% and heal you for that amount. With a 1.5 minute cooldown, you will have this ability available for almost every enemy team's offensive push. When being focused by classes who will pop cooldowns while you're stunned, try to use this ability _before_ you get stunned for maximum value. When executed properly, this little move will allow you to hold on to bigger cooldowns such as Pain Suppression, Power Word: Barrier, and even Trinket for much longer into the game.

One big component to succeeding in arena is knowing when to use cooldowns and to also minimize how often you overlap them. For example - if your Mage is getting bursted down and you cast *Pain Suppression* on him and he immediately uses his own *Ice Block*, you're now down two defensive cooldowns for the price of one. Having strong communication with your team can help mitigate overlapping damage reductions.


## Macros & Keybinds <a name="macros"></a>

Keybindings are a matter of personal preference, but there are a few specific tasks which you should have bound in PvP. 

You'll certainly want to have keybindings for targeting yourself, targeting party1, and targeting party2. These are configurable through the default interface (`Esc` -> `Key Bindings` -> `Targeting`). You'll also want keybindings for targeting arena1, arena2, and arena3 for when you need to Purge a buff or assist in damage.

In arenas, you really don't want to be relying on either mouseover macros or having to click a unit frame to heal as things are too frantic and mouse movement is too important. The sooner you set those key bindings up and become accustomed to them the easier everything else will become.

For example, many players use this common setup:

```
+------+---------------------+--------------+
| -    | Target Party        | Target Enemy |
+------+---------------------+--------------+
| Self | Middle mouse button | -            |
| 1    | Mouse scroll up     | Alt + 1      |
| 2    | Mouse scroll down   | Alt + 2      |
| 3    | -                   | Alt + 3      |
+------+---------------------+--------------+
```

Macros are also a matter of personal preference to some degree. As you get more practice in arena, you'll start to find more macros or keybinds that you wish you had. Don't beat yourself up over not getting used to new keybinds immediately; it takes practice and a lot of dedication. Ultimately how you set up your character's bars is up to you, but here's some macros I've found useful. 


Dispelling (generic Purge effect, or useful for getting Mind Control off of a friendly target):

```
#showtooltip
/stopcasting
/stopcasting
/cast [help] Purify; [harm] Dispel Magic
/cast [@player] Purify
```

Dispel Party 1 

```
#showtooltip
/stopcasting

```

Dispel Self

```
#showtooltip
/stopcasting

```

Focus Purge

```
#showtooltip

Mind Control arena1, arena2, arena3:

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@arena1] Mind Control
```

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@arena2] Mind Control
```

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@arena3] Mind Control
```

Angelic Feather macro for quickly casting it on yourself:

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@player] Angelic Feather
/stopspelltarget
```

Pain Suppression isn't on the global cooldown, meaning you can pair it with Power Word: Shield.
```
#showtooltip
/cast Pain Suppression
/cast Power Word: Shield
```

## Addons <a name="addons"></a>

These days, most of the useful information you'll need to be successful in arena is baked into the default UI. However, there are still a few addons I would recommend for making sure you have all the necessary information quickly available in your interface.

[Gladius](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/gladius) - The standard arena unit frame addon. It shows remaining diminishing return timers on your enemies, as well as which Tier 1 PvP talent they have selected, curring spells being cast, and a cooldown tracker. I recommend having this some place prominent in your arena UI, and it's definitely worth spending time tweaking it and practicing reading it at a glance.

[OmniBar](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/omnibar) - OmniBar tracks enemy cooldowns and is highly customizable. It's very helpful for knowing when you need to fake cast against an interrupt or knowing when the enemy team's CC chain may start up again.

[SortGroup](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/sortgroup) - Allows you to determine the order of party frames, so that you're always at the top (or bottom) of your party. This is helpful when arenaing because the order in which the group is assembled is based on who loads in to the arena first, meaning you will likely have a different party layout each match. This addon helps manage that minor headache. 

[Details!](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/details) - A very informative DPS meter. I use it to track interrupts and incoming CC / CC breaks when discussing how to improve after a match with my team.

## Tips & Tricks <a name="tips"></a>

Knowing when to heal via Atonement versus direct heals is an art form and requires lots of practice to master. Don't get discouraged! When starting off, err to the side of caution by keeping your teammates topped off with Shields and defensive Penances and Shadow Mends -- fancy damage plays will come once you find your bearings. 

At the start of the arena match, try to quickly cast Power Word: Shields on your teammates to help mitigate the enemy team's opener and get Atonement rolling for your Mastery bonus healing. 

When facing against Restoration or Balance Druids, you can Mass Dispel Cyclones off of your teammates - just be wary of its cooldown and mana cost.

You can use *Premonition* to get out of most CC abilities classified as Incapacitates, and even some Disorients based on how many Atonements you have active (as *Premonition*'s damage scales with number of Atonements, and some CCs like Warlock Fear have a damage component to them). 

 - Demon Hunter: Imprison (unless talented)
 - Druid: Feral's Enraged Maim talent, Incapacitating Roar
 - Hunter: Wyvern Sting, Freezing Trap, Bursting Shot, Scatter Shot
 - Mage: Polymorph
 - Monk: Paralysis
 - Paladin: Repentance, Blinding Light
 - Priest: Chastise (unless talented)
 - Pandaren: Quaking Palm racial
 - Rogue: Gogue, Sap, Blind
 - Shaman: Hex
 - Warlock: Fear, Succubus Seduction

Premonition can also be used as a free of mana cost heal on allies with Atonments/extend Atonement duration, which is great in RBGs where you have many Atonements out.

Stay on top of Purging buffs from enemy Mages without blowing through too much mana! You can take their major DPS cooldowns (Combustion, Arcane Power, Icy Veins) and also their survivability cooldowns (Temporal Shield, Prismatic Barrier; Ice Block and Mass Invisibility via Mass Dispel).

When playing against a Rogue, try to have one of your teammates get into combat as soon as possible. If you heal somebody in combat with a quick Plea, you will get pulled into combat too and thus not be Sappable. (Works great with Hunter pets!)

You can use *Shackle Undead* against a Death Knight's pets to temporarily remove them from the match. This is particularly strong against their Summon Gargoyle 3 minute DPS cooldown.

You can place your *Power Word: Barrier* over an enemy Rogue's Smoke Bomb; friendlies inside will still receive the benefit.

If an enemy Priest Mind Controls one of your teammates, you can Purge the effect off of him.
