# Discipline Priest PvP Guide - 7.2.5

## Introduction

TODO: Not complain about Holy being more meta right now. Nerf Warriors pls.

## Gearing

As of the release of Legion, PvP the stats on your equipment no longer matter in instanced PvP. Instead, whenever a player enters an arena, battleground, or rated battleground, a stat template is applied to the character. This stat template is inflexible and pre-determined, i.e. there's no way to influence your template to have more Haste. 

TODO: Take a screenshot showing how stats change.

## Talents - 3v3

### Standard talents
TL;DR: This is the default talent loadout.

### PvP Standard talents
TL;DR: This is the default talent loadout.
![PvP Standard talents](img/3v3honortalents.png)

#### Row 1
![PvP talents row1](img/honor1.png)

#### Row 2
![PvP talents row2](img/honor2.png)

**Usually take -** *Vim and Vigor*. Due to Disciplne's tankiness through *Focused Will* and reliance on instant cast spells, Priests are not usually a kill target. Due to this you'll spend most games sitting at high health for the entire duration of the match, allowing for a passive +20% healing. 

**Maybe take -** *Defender of the Weak* or *Inner Renewal*. *Defender of the Weak* is a solid option against teams with a propensity for fast target switching. The haste bonus will allow you to quickly Shadow Mend a teammate back into safe levels of health after they drop very low. In arenas, Discipline's primary weakness is their propensity to burn through mana very quickly, especially if you are actively Purging the enemy team (say, against Resto Druids). *Inner Renewal* has the potenetial to give huge mana savings over the course of a match if you know the enemy team will be focusing you. At low ratings, a lot of double melee teams or triple DPS teams will simply try to burst down a healer - here *Inner Renewal* can really shine. At higher ratings though, you won't often get the most use out of this talent compared to the other two.

#### Row 3
![PvP talents row3](img/honor3.png)

**Usually take -** *Purification*. This is a standard "double dispel" talent and is great against any team with area of effect dispellable magic (a Mage's Frost Nova) or any team with spammable crowd control (Polymorph, Warlock Fear). A large portion of a healer's responsibilty in arena is limiting enemy crowd control against your team and mitigating their damage - being able to dispel more frequently is key.

**Maybe take -** *Purified Resolve*. Against teams with infrequent dispellable debuffs, this talent can be preferable to *Purification*. An example would be playing aginst Unholy Death Knights - there's typically rarely a need to defensively dispel, but doing so would somewhat limit incoming damage and apply a shield to help mitigate the single target onslaught.

**Rarely take-** *Spiritual Cleansing*. This talent has a niche depending on what classes you're playing with and what team you're facing. If you're not sure whether this is worth taking, stick with *Purification*. 

#### Row 4
![PvP talents row4](img/honor4.png)

**Almost always take -** *Premonition*. This talent is the stand in for the old utility of *Shadow Word: Death* - that is, it applies a small amount of damage to the Priest on a delay, allowing them to break incoming crowd control. You'll always want to take this against classes that contain breakable crowd control, namely a Mage's Polymorph, Hunter traps and Wyvern Sting, Shaman Hex, Monk and Feral Druid Incapicitates, et cetera. There's almost always at least one use for this in a match.

**Sometimes take -** *Searing Light*. If there's nothing for you to break out of with *Premonition*, then *Searing Light* can be a good alternative. This talent allows you to play a bit more aggressively with offensive Smites and Penances to help apply more pressure. 

**Never take -** *Trinity*. This is an exceptionally clunky talent and isn't particularly useful, as most of your healing in most arena matches will not come from Atonement but rather direct Penances, Power Word: Radiance, Shadow Mend, and shields.

#### Row 5
![PvP talents row5](img/honor5.png)

**Almost always take -** *Ultimate Radiance*. This talent makes Power Word: Radiance instant cast and directly heal for a lot more than in PvE situations. It has a double effect of quickly applying a large amount of healing to the whole team (assuming they're relatively close to each other) _and_ applying Atonement to the entire team. And as of patch 7.2.5, Discipline Priests now have two charges of the spell, allowing for some serious instant cast burst healing to the entire group. This can be huge for recovering from split pressure against rot teams, or simply keeping one person alive while dodging interrupts and counter spells.

**Sometimes take -** *Strength of Soul*. With patch 7.2.5, *Strength of Soul* was buffed to heal significantly more than it had previously. Further, now that most players have unlocked their new artifact traits, our Power Word: Shields contribute a lot more healing than they used to. Add to this how strong many physical melee classes are, such as Arms Warriors, and this talent can be really strong in the right situations. It's important to remember, however, that a lot of melee have magical components to their attacks - a lot of a Death Knight's damage is Shadow or Frost damage, for example, and Strength of Shield would not offer any help mitigating that damage. 

**Never take -** *Dome of Light*. The competition on this tier is just too good to justify this talent. Add on top of that how easy it is to pull people out of your Power Word: Barrier, and this talent just falls a bit short.

#### Row 6
![PvP talents row6](img/honor6.png)

**Almost always take -** *Archangel*. This talent is the *Velen's Future Sight* of PvP. It's single handedly one of the strongest healing buffs any healer has in PvP, and only on a one minute cooldown. It's recommended that you grind to honor level 28 as soon as possible to unlock this talent.

**Rarely take -** *Dark Archangel*. This is a fun talent to help your team instagib an enemy, but if you aren't able to secure a kill reliably in the opener, you will quickly fall behind by not having *Archangel.* This is mostly fun at low ratings with mongo comps, but should not be considered in the vast majority of real arena matches.

**Never take -** *Power Word: Fortitude*. As of patch 7.2.5, this effect is no longer Purgable, which moves it from being a waste of a GCD into just simply a weak option. An extra 20% health for your team won't help reverse falling into a bad CC chain, nor will it help you recover from an enemy stumbling their way into critting one of your teammates several times during a burst. There's no reason to take this talent over *Archangel*.


## Common compositions - 3v3

Discipline Priest's main weakness in arena is the clock: simply put, we run out of mana faster than every other healer. Because of this, Priest works best in control comps - that is, comps where your team can lock down enemy players repeatedly to help ensure a quick game. The longer a game goes on, the faster a Priest will OOM and the tougher it will be to secure a victory.

Let's take a look at some of the common strong compositions Discipline Priests are running in Legion Season 4:

TODO: Give a quick rundown on how to play each of these.

## Common opponents - 3v3

### TSG - Arms Warrior / Unholy Death Knight / Healer

### Ebola - Unholy DK / Feral Druid / Healer
