**Usually take -** *Vim and Vigor*. Due to Disciplne's tankiness through *Focused Will* and reliance on instant cast spells, Priests are not usually a kill target. Due to this you'll spend most games sitting at high health for the entire duration of the match, allowing for a passive +20% healing. 

**Maybe take -** *Defender of the Weak* or *Inner Renewal*. *Defender of the Weak* is a solid option against teams with a propensity for fast target switching. The haste bonus will allow you to quickly Shadow Mend a teammate back into safe levels of health after they drop very low. In arenas, Discipline's primary weakness is their propensity to burn through mana very quickly, especially if you are actively Purging the enemy team (say, against Resto Druids). *Inner Renewal* has the potenetial to give huge mana savings over the course of a match if you know the enemy team will be focusing you. At low ratings, a lot of double melee teams or triple DPS teams will simply try to burst down a healer - here *Inner Renewal* can really shine. At higher ratings though, you won't often get the most use out of this talent compared to the other two.
